# NullClass Generative AI Internship Tasks

This repository contains the completed projects for the NullClass Generative AI Internship. The internship involved completing three distinct tasks, each focused on a different aspect of building and evaluating AI applications.

## Projects

### 1. [Task 1: LLM Article Generator](./Task-1-article_generator/)
A chatbot that uses three different open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B, Phi-3-mini, and Gemma-2B-IT) to generate articles. This project focuses on model comparison and qualitative evaluation.

### 2. [Task 2: Multi-Modal Chatbot](./Task-2-MultiModal-Chatbot/)
A multi-modal application built with Streamlit and Google's Gemini Pro/Vision models. The chatbot can understand and respond to both text and image inputs.

### 3. [Task 3: Sentiment-Aware Chatbot](./task-3-sentiment-chatbot/)
A chatbot that integrates sentiment analysis using TextBlob. It detects the user's emotional tone and adapts its responses accordingly. The model's performance was verified using scikit-learn.
